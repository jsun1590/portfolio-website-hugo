        content: This was a research project with the Quantitative Finance club at UWA with the objective to investigate the effectiveness of using the mean reversion trading strategy in automated HFT trading. In a team of 4, we developed an algorithm in Python that made use of indicators such as Bollinger Bands and RSI to effectively execute trades, bringing us a return performance just below the market index.
